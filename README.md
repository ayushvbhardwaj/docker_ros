##Clone the repository:
##git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker_ros.git
##cd docker_ros
(Replace your-username with the correct username.)

##Build the Docker image:
##docker build -t ros_docker .

##Run a ROS container:
##docker run -it ros_docker bash

Usage

Once inside the container, you can use ROS commands. Remember to source your ROS environment:
source /opt/ros/<your_ros_distro>/setup.bash
(Replace <your_ros_distro> with your ROS distribution, e.g., noetic.)

Customization

Modify the Dockerfile to install additional ROS packages or change the ROS distribution.

Troubleshooting

Common issues include Docker not running or not sourcing the ROS setup script inside the container.
